It took a hot minute, but I finally got an Azure Pipeline to deploy my hugo source to GitHub Pages.

It isn't **pretty**, and I'd like to write something without using pieced together marketplace tasks (if possible), but I'll take what I can get for now!

I hope I can use this as a way to test out and share knowledge.
