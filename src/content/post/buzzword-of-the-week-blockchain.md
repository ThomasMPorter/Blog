Welcome to Buzzword of the week! 

Each week, I'll do a shallow dive into a technical phrase or technology that you've (probably) heard about. I don't claim to be the expert on these, but I think **everyone** should cursory knowledge of what each one means.

This week: **Blockchain**

## introduction

Starting off with a big one! If you haven't head the word blockchain uttered at least once around you, my question is "How?"

If you haven't heard about it specifically, you've definitely heard of a technology that uses it: BitCoin (A Crypto currency).

## One Line Description

Really secure (but slow) linked list

## What it is

A ledger of information that is distributed across multiple locations. Ideal for situation where you want to make sure there isn't any shenanigans about with the sequencing. You know, like currency.

## Why it is

Crypto currency. Plain and simple, about 5 years ago, bitcoin was literally printing money. So, as often the case, the technology used in one wildly successful scope must translate to another, right?!? Soon, blockchain was disrupting the industry.

## Is it bad?

## When will it end

When computing ability has the ability to "own the horde". It just needs to be fast enough to update 51% of the distributed authorities for a chain. Quantum Computing will make this possible, but the number of qbit you need would mean some expensive setup.
