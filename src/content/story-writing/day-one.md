In this series of posts, I'm going to follow the process outlined in  [Michael A. Stackpole's "Twenty-one Days to a
Novel"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029O0ANM/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_8eH0Cb6P4MPBB).

I am **not** going to explain the steps, just show the results of each day. I would feel right just posting something that is for sale
