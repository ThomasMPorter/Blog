In this series of posts, I'm going to follow the process outlined in  [Michael A. Stackpole's "Twenty-one Days to a
Novel"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029O0ANM/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_8eH0Cb6P4MPBB).

I am **not** going to explain each day's activity, just show the results. I would feel right just posting details about something that you should buy and read yourself.

## Day One

- Phil can't remember how long he was laying there before Sarah found him, in fact he couldn't remember much of anything.
- This wasn't where he belonged, Phil wasn't from this fantasy world where was there was no technology anywhere.
