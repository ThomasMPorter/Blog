I’ve been a full time software engineer since 2006. Most of the projects that I have been involved in professionally are n-tiered website applications with a database data source. I’ve been involved in all stages of the software development process (designing, documenting, implementing, testing, review, deployment, etc.). Agile is my preferred software development methodology. In the past I’ve mentored coworkers and peer reviewed their work.

I strive to design and implement projects with elegance, security, and usability in mind. My expertise is with Microsoft and related technologies, but I’ve worked with universal standards and frameworks that transcend Microsoft products. I enjoy working on user interfaces, creating user documentation, and solving/troubleshooting complex problems.
